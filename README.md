ECOSYS3D is a powerful tool that makes high-performance ocean ecosystem modeling approachable and fun. Since
it is a pure Python module, the days of struggling with complicated
model setup workflows, ancient programming environments, and obscure
legacy code are finally over.

ECOSYS3D supports both a NumPy backend for small-scale problems and a fully
parallelized high-performance backend [powered by
Bohrium](https://github.com/bh107/bohrium) using either OpenMP (CPU) or
OpenCL (GPU), and runs on distributed architectures via MPI.



## Features

ECOSSYS3D provides

-   offline ecosystem model runs for ROMS
-   **accessibility, readability, and extensibility** - thanks to the
    power of Python!
